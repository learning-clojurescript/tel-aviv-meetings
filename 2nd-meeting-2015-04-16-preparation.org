* Preparation for the [[http://www.meetup.com/Clojure-Israel/events/221324856/][2nd meeting]]

On our 2nd meeting we will begin a patient, thourough reading of
[[http://www.niwi.be/cljs-workshop/][Andrey Antukh's tutorial]].

- Before the meeting, please review basic Clojurescript syntax in [[https://github.com/shaunlebron/ClojureScript-Syntax-in-15-minutes][this
  15 minutes tutorial]]. 

- It is highly recommended to finish the [[https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/wiki/Quick-Start][Quick Start tutorial]] that we started
  on the [[http://www.meetup.com/Clojure-Israel/events/220777364/][1st meeting ]](we are not planning to complete it together).

- Please think whether you have any questions regarding the [[http://www.meetup.com/Clojure-Israel/events/220777364/][1st
  meeting]]. Please and write such questions down as messages in the 
  meetup page -- probably other people wish to know, too. If you wish,
  you may also contact Daniel Slutsky at [daniel dot slutsky at gmail
  dot com].
