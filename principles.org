* Main principles for our meetings

The following are the result of discussion on the [[http://www.meetup.com/Clojure-Israel/events/220777364/][1st meeting]].

** Content

- The main purpose of the meetings is to make Clojurescript accessible
  to beginners.

- Therefore, we focus on practical issues of language, project
  organization, tooling, etc.; we will meet the more conceptual ideas
  on our way, as they are manifested in practical solutions.

** Calendar

- We will meet every 2-3 weeks, on Thursdays.

** Materials

- We will use mainly free, online materials, so that members who miss
  some meeting can always keep up.

- Meeting notes will be publicly available.

- We will have a syllabus, planning several meetings ahead.

** Participation

- Please invite friends to join. If you do so, please tell them a bit
  about what we have already discussed.

- Please prepare to the meetings.

- If you have questions, please share them online the group and/or bring those questions to the meetings.  

** Possible changes of our meetings

- Maybe watch video lectures together?

- Maybe have some homework?

- On one of the next meetings, we will try to meet at the openspace
  (rather than the lecture halls).
