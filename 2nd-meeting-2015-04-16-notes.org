2015-04-16 Clojurescript meeting

* Short summary of the [[http://www.meetup.com/Clojure-Israel/events/221324856/][2nd meeting]]
- Participants: Ynon, Daniel, Barak, Evgeny, Zvi, Hagai, Shai, Gideon

- We decided that meeting discussions will take place in [[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/clojure-israel][the Google group]].
  *Please join this group to keep in touch and get updates*.

- We introduced ourselves.

- We reviewed the previous meeting.

** Development tools
- We briefly mentioned some of the common development tools of Clojure and Clojurescript. See more details below.

- We played just a bit with Bruce Hauman's [[https://github.com/bhauman/devcards][Devcards]], a nice visual development tool for Clojurescript.

** Syntax
- We reviewed some Clojurescript syntax using parts of [[http://www.niwi.be/cljs-workshop/#_first_steps_with_clojurescript][Section 4 of Andrey Antukh's tutorial]].

** Continuing [[http://www.niwi.be/cljs-workshop/][Andrey Antukh's tutorial]]:

*** Impoartant note
Please install Leiningen directly from its [[http://leiningen.org/][web page]], not from your package manager's repositories.

*** [[http://www.niwi.be/cljs-workshop/#_first_clojurescript_hello_world][Section 4]]
We just reviewed some parts for basic Clojurescript syntax.

*** [[http://www.niwi.be/cljs-workshop/#_first_steps_with_clojurescript][Section 5]]
We went through this short section, discussing the basic details in programming a Clojurescript Hello World app.

** Clojure's and Clojurescript's compilation process
We mentioned the main stages and discussed the role of Google Closure Compiler. See more details below.

* More notes from the [[http://www.meetup.com/Clojure-Israel/events/221324856/][2nd meeting]]

*** IDEs
- Maybe discuss those some other time?
- Gideon told about Chris Granger's [[http://lighttable.com/][Lighttable]] written in Clojurescript and [[http://www.chris-granger.com/2013/01/24/the-ide-as-data/][BOT methodology]].
- Zvi told about the successor, [[http://incidentalcomplexity.com/2014/10/16/retrospective/][eve]] (written by the same author, no longer in Clojurescript).

** Some details about the compilation process
Here are the resources used in the meeting:
*** Clojure's compilation process
- read some notes from the [[http://www.braveclojure.com/read-and-eval/][relevant chapter of Daniel Higginbotham's "Clojure for the Brave and True"]].
*** Clojurescript 
- had a brief discussion, based on the diagrams taken from
[[http://blog.fogus.me/2012/04/25/the-clojurescript-compilation-pipeline/][Michael Fogus'es notes]].
You may want to read more into these notes, as well as some other
posts mentioned at their bottom.

*** Google Closure Compiler
- discussed how it is involved Google's Closure Compiler is involved in
the Clojurescript compiler.

- played with an [[http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home][online version]] of it, noticing dramatic differences
  between the different modes of optimization.


** Other things mentioned

*** React
During and after the talk we have had some discussions of [[https://facebook.github.io/react/][ReactJS]] and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRmj3IUkRVk][its uses in Clojurescript]].
[[http://www.niwi.be/cljs-workshop/][Andrey Antukh's tutorial]] teaches about [[https://github.com/omcljs/om][Om]], which is one of the Clojurescript libraries using React. We hope to reach this part in about 2-3 meetings.
Just before the meeting, Ynon wrote [[https://www.tocode.co.il/blog/2015-04-react-rails][a blog post]] about it.
